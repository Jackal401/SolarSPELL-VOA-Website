                            <em>planning</em> helps us to continue to learn well.</p>

                            Notice how they talk about a list of the things they will do. "First, we’re going to
                            introduce the subject. Then we can show pictures and video. ... We can interview
                            children and have guests too. Great idea! Finally, we can read the questions and
                            tell them where to learn more."</p>
